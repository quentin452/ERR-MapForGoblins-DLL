# Findings — MapGenie category coverage verification

Companion to `windows_mapgenie_category_coverage_re_prompt.md` and
`docs/plans/mapgenie_category_coverage_plan.md`. Each entry: verified field + value(s),
the real row(s) used, and CONFIRMED / WRONG vs the plan's hypothesis.

Method note: verification reads `regulation.bin` **off disk** via SoulsFormats
(`tools/verify_disablerespawn.py`). Params are baked verbatim into `regulation.bin` and the
game loads that same table into memory at boot, so a disk read is value-identical to the live
`from::params::get_param` path — no running game or memory attach needed. Params are NOT
streamed; every row is resident regardless of the player's map. (Streaming only applies to MSB
placement + textures, which this tier does not touch.)

---

## Part A(a) — `WorldFarmableEnemy` — PARTIALLY WRONG (gate needs a 2nd condition)

**Field:** `NpcParam.disableRespawn` (u8 bitfield `:1`, JP "リスポン禁止か" = "respawn prohibited?").
**Tool:** `tools/verify_disablerespawn.py` (run for `err` and `MFG_PROFILE=vanilla`).

**Distribution (mod-agnostic — same semantics both installs):**
- vanilla: 6713 rows `dr=0`, 326 rows `dr=1` (of 7039)
- ERR:     6435 rows `dr=0`, 433 rows `dr=1` (of 6868)

**Verified polarity:**
- **`dr=1` → reliably one-time / NOT farmable. CONFIRMED.** The `dr=1` set is invaders, questline
  NPCs, and event/prop dummy rows — e.g. Melina `21801000`, Millicent `523480156`, Sir Ansbach
  `524160199`, Needle Knight Leda `524180189`, Festering Fingerprint Vyke `523040020`, Mad Tongue
  Alberich `523850000`, Blaidd's one-time fight `20109140`, Castellan Edgar boss-version
  `533110000`, plus non-enemy props ("Smithing Table" `500010000`, "Twin Maiden Husks"
  `500020079`). None are respawning trash.
- **`dr=0` → NOT a farmable signal. HYPOTHESIS WRONG.** The main fog-gated bosses read `dr=0` in
  **both** vanilla and ERR: Rennala `20300000` (vanilla) / `20300024` (ERR), Draconic Tree Sentinel
  `32500072`, etc. Their non-respawn is enforced by the boss-defeat **event flag + fog gate**, not by
  `disableRespawn`. So `dr=0` over-includes bosses.

**Consequence for implementation:** the plan's assumption that "`disableRespawn` should always be 1
for bosses anyway" is **false** — bosses read 0. `disableRespawn` alone is not a safe gate. Correct
gate:

    WorldFarmableEnemy  ⇔  disableRespawn == 0  AND  NOT already classified as boss/named-NPC

i.e. reuse the existing `WorldBosses` / named-NPC classification in `goblin_inject.cpp` to exclude
those first, then treat `dr==0` on the remaining trash as farmable. `dr==1` can be used as a hard
"never farmable" short-circuit (reliable in that direction).

**Row-identity caveat:** the same name can map to two NpcParam rows with different `dr` (Castellan
Edgar `523110000` dr=0 friendly vs `533110000` dr=1 boss). The classifier must read the
`NPCParamID` of the *placed* enemy instance, not a name lookup.

**Confidence:** HIGH. Reproducible via `tools/verify_disablerespawn.py`, matches across vanilla+ERR.

---

## Part A(b) — `WorldFarmableCollectible` — HYPOTHESIS WRONG (wrong field), corrected + simpler

**Tool:** `tools/verify_farmable_collectible.py` (run for `err` and `MFG_PROFILE=vanilla`).

**The plan's field is wrong.** It cited `getItemFlagId01/02/03` ("any of 3 slots == 0"). The paramdef
(`tools/paramdefs/ItemLotParam.xml`) actually has **8** per-slot fields `getItemFlagId01..08` (one per
lot item slot) PLUS a single master `getItemFlagId`. And empirically:

- **Per-slot `01..08` are ALWAYS 0** — 0 lots out of the full table have any nonzero per-slot flag, in
  BOTH `ItemLotParam_map` and `ItemLotParam_enemy`, on BOTH vanilla and ERR. They are unused override
  slots (paramdef: "0 = 共通使用" = "0 = use the shared/master one"). So "any of N slots == 0" is a
  non-signal — checking them is pointless.
- **The authoritative field is the single master `getItemFlagId`** (paramdef "0 = フラグ無効" =
  "0 = flag disabled"). This is exactly what the existing tool `tools/dump_loot_flags.py` already reads,
  and what the live overlay path already reads at `goblin_inject.cpp:4720`
  (`getItemFlagId @ +0x80`, commented "lot-wide … authoritative").

**Polarity CONFIRMED:** `getItemFlagId == 0` → no persistent acquire flag → farmable; `!= 0` → tracked.
Nonzero rows are the one-time uniques (Larval Tear `flag=12017985`, Dragon Communion Seal, Omen Bairn,
Immunizing Horn Charm); zero rows are re-rollable enemy/material drops (Old Fang, Neutralizing Boluses).

**Distribution (sanity-consistent):**
- vanilla: `ItemLotParam_map` 517 farmable / 5047 tracked · `ItemLotParam_enemy` 4891 farmable / 244 tracked
- ERR:     `ItemLotParam_map` 2094 / 7128 · `ItemLotParam_enemy` 5369 / 477
- Most MAP lots are tracked (world pickups are grab-once); most ENEMY lots are farmable (trash re-drops).

**Refinement — nonzero is NOT automatically "one-time" (live-only distinction):** `goblin_inject.cpp`
already distinguishes *persistent* one-time flags from *repeatable* flags (nonzero flags with no
save-backed obtained bit) via `flag_is_repeatable()` (live group-allocation query, `:4679`, used at
`:4736`/`:4799`). A repeatable nonzero flag is still effectively farmable. So the correct farmable test
is not `flag == 0` alone but:

    WorldFarmableCollectible  ⇔  getItemFlagId == 0  OR  flag_is_repeatable(getItemFlagId)

This is a static-vs-live gap: the disk read sees zero/nonzero; the repeatable-vs-persistent split of the
nonzero set needs the runtime query. Not a blocker — the live path already computes exactly this.

**Implementation impact:** SIMPLER than the plan assumed. The field is already read live at the loot
site (`resolve_loot_flag`, `:4700`) and `flag_is_repeatable` already exists — `WorldFarmableCollectible`
needs zero new param plumbing, just a category branch reusing that resolved value.

**Composition with A(a):** enemy-drop collectible is farmable only if the enemy also respawns —
`enemy.disableRespawn == 0` (A(a)) AND lot farmable. Map gathering nodes: lot farmable alone.

**Row-noise caveat:** the lowest lot IDs (0/1/2/100/…) are internal/template rows (e.g. the starting
Flask of Crimson Tears at lot 2, `flag=0`), not world placements. Only lots referenced by a placed
asset/enemy reach the classifier, so this template noise is irrelevant in practice.

**Confidence:** HIGH. Reproducible via `tools/verify_farmable_collectible.py`; the authoritative offset
+0x80 is already live-cross-validated in shipped code.

## Tier 2 — `WorldMapPointParam.iconId` landmarks — VERIFIED (real iconIds found; ~half the categories are NOT WMPP)

**Tool:** `tools/verify_worldmap_iconids.py` (groups `WorldMapPointParam` rows by `iconId`, resolves
`textId1..8` → `PlaceName`). Feeds off `extract_world_map_param.py` + `extract_placename_dump.py`.
Confirmed stable vanilla (472 rows) ↔ ERR (740 rows): **iconId semantics are byte-identical**; ERR only
decorates the point *text* with boss-status labels (Resurrected/Defeated/Encountered) — the iconId
itself is unchanged, so this is a safe mod-agnostic key.

**First correction:** the plan's Tier-2 numbers ("Divine Tower — 6, Dragon Shrine — 2, Dungeon — 64…")
are **MapGenie pin-COUNTS, not iconIds** (same format as the Tier-1 count list). The real iconIds:

**(A) Categories that ARE a clean `WorldMapPointParam.iconId` (wireable now, same pattern as grace):**

| MapGenie category | Real iconId | Evidence (place names under that iconId) |
|---|---|---|
| **Divine Tower** | **23** | exactly the 6 Divine Towers (Limgrave/Liurnia/W-Altus/Caelid/E-Altus/Isolated) — matches count 6 |
| **Evergaol** | **9** | Weeping/Stormhill/Forlorn Hound/Ringleader's/… Evergaol |
| **Minor Erdtree** | **30** | 11 rows all "Minor Erdtree" — matches count 11 |
| **Elevator (grand lifts only)** | **21** | ONLY Grand Lift of Dectus + Rold (2 rows). **NOT** MapGenie's 40 "Elevator" pins (those are in-dungeon lifts, not WMPP — see B). |
| **Dungeon** (MapGenie's single "Dungeon" = a UNION of ER's typed minor dungeons) | **4** Catacombs · **13** Caves · **14** Tunnels · **16** Hero's Graves · **15** Wells · DLC **230** Catacombs · **231** Gaols · **234** Caves | each iconId is one dungeon *type*; union ≈ MapGenie's 64 |
| **Legacy Dungeon** | per-location UNIQUE icons, no single value: Stormveil **50**, Raya Lucaria **51**, Haligtree **55**, Elphael **56**, Volcano Manor **58**, Farum Azula **59**, Leyndell **60**, Shunning-Grounds **61**, Carian Study Hall **66**, DLC Belurat **210**, Enir-Ilim **211**, Shadow Keep **213**, Midra's Manse **218** | each major site has its own bespoke icon; classify by iconId ∈ this set |

Bonus clean ones seen (not requested but same mechanism): Churches **3**, Ruins **5**, Shacks **6**,
Lookout Towers **8**, Gates **10**, Sorcerer Rises **17**, Forts **18**, Colosseums **24**, Eternal
Cities **46**, DLC Forges **232**, DLC Churches **247**.

**(B) Requested categories that are NOT in `WorldMapPointParam` — hypothesis source WRONG, need a
different data path:** WMPP only holds *named-location* world-map markers. These are small in-world
interactables/dynamic entities with no WMPP row:

- **Smithing Table** — an AEG interactable asset, not a WMPP. Needs an MSB/`AssetEnvironmentGeometry`
  placement scan (same family as the loot-asset path `pickUpItemLotParamId @ +0xb8`, `:4876`).
- **Martyr Effigy** — the summoning-pool effigies → SummoningPool data / MSB assets. `tools/generate_summoning_pools.py`
  already sources these; reuse that, not WMPP.
- **Stone Cairn**, **Hidden Passage** — small interactables, no WMPP row → MSB/AEG or EMEVD.
- **Portal** (waygates) — no clean WMPP icon; "Sending Gate" shows up mixed under iconId **87** with
  Volcano-Manor-request markers, so 87 is NOT a pure Portal icon. Waygates are MSB warp assets.
- **Wandering Mausoleum** — the WALKING mausoleums are dynamic entities; iconId **45** is ONLY the static
  "Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum". A moving-mausoleum layer would need runtime entity tracking, not a param.
- **Dragon Shrine** — no distinct icon; "Church/Cathedral of Dragon Communion" fold into Churches
  (iconId **3**). The Dragon Communion altars are interactables. Flag ambiguous — do not force a WMPP key.
- **Landmark** (MapGenie's 172) — a catch-all bucket, not a single ER icon; skip as a category.

**(C) Unlabeled dense iconId buckets** (not among the 14 requested; carry NO place-name text): iconId
**80** (71 rows), **83** (70 rows), **84**/**85** (16 each). Left unclassified — none of the requested
named-landmark categories map here. Identify later only if a future category needs them.

**Implementation guidance:** Tier 2's *wireable* subset is (A) — read `row.iconId` at the
`WorldMapPointParam` site and classify by the table above (single value for Divine Tower/Evergaol/Minor
Erdtree/Grand Lift; set-membership for Dungeon and Legacy Dungeon). The (B) categories must be
redirected to asset/summoning-pool/EMEVD sources and should NOT be scoped as WMPP work.

**Confidence:** HIGH for (A) (exact name clusters, counts match, stable across vanilla+ERR). (B) is a
confident *negative* (absence from WMPP is direct), but the positive source for each (B) category is
itself a further RE task, not resolved here.

## Tier 3 — `NpcParam` teamType/npcType — HYPOTHESIS MOSTLY WRONG (only "Ghost" is param-clean, and already shipped)

**Tool:** `tools/verify_npc_teamtype.py` (vanilla, with ERR field-existence cross-check).

The plan hoped one shared `teamType`/`npcType` pass would emit all six NPC categories (Character, Ghost,
Merchant, Trainer, Elite Enemy, Enemy). It does not — **neither field is a stable per-NPC category key:**

- **`teamType` is a per-ROW combat allegiance (state), not a per-NPC class.** Every notable NPC has 3–6
  NpcParam rows spread across teams for its different states. Examples (vanilla): Roundtable Knight Vyke
  appears in teams {27, 2, 6}; Needle Knight Leda in {26, 1, 6, 2, 27}; Millicent in {26, 0, 27};
  Merchant Kalé in {0, 26, 28}. So reading one `teamType` cannot tell you an NPC's MapGenie category —
  it tells you which side that one *state row* fights on.
- **`npcType` is effectively unusable.** All-rows distribution vanilla `{0: 6876, 1: 163}`; but the
  `npcType==1` set is only **4 distinct NAMED rows** (DLC dummy, Baleful Shadow, Rennala, Gurranq) — the
  other 159 are unnamed template/boss-frame rows (teamType 7×78, 6×40, 33×36). Not a trash/boss category
  signal in practice.

**The one clean, param-derivable signal — and it is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED:**
- **MapGenie "Ghost" = NPC invader = `teamType ∈ {24,27}` ∧ `nameId > 0`.** This is verbatim the shipped
  `WorldHostileNPC` classifier (`src/goblin_inject.hpp:360-361`, `src/worldmap/map_entry_layer.cpp:1256`;
  teamType read live @ +0x133, `goblin_inject.cpp:4998`). Vanilla: 184 rows carry teamType {24,27}
  (~60 distinct invader names — White Mask Varré, Bloody Finger Nerijus, Okina, Recusant Henricus, Mad
  Tongue Alberich, Vyke, …), lining up with MapGenie "Ghost — 57". Populated on ERR too (116 rows), and
  the classifier already reads live NpcParam so it is mod-agnostic by construction. **⇒ Tier 3's "Ghost"
  needs no new work — it IS `WorldHostileNPC`.**

**The other five need non-teamType sources (do NOT scope as a NpcParam teamType pass):**
- **Merchant** — the signal is "has a shop" = a `ShopLineupParam` block for that NPC (different param),
  not any NpcParam field. Kalé/Patches/etc. carry ordinary friendly teamTypes indistinguishable from
  non-merchant NPCs.
- **Character** (friendly quest NPC) — this is the `QuestNpcLayer` set (already merged to master, see
  `docs/memory/features/quest-browser.md`). Same population MapGenie calls "Character". Reuse it.
- **Trainer** (MapGenie count 1) — a single hand-identified NPC, not a param class. Identify by name/id.
- **Elite Enemy / Enemy** — these are *notability tiers* among hostile enemies, not a teamType. The repo
  already computes this via `tools/datamine_enemy_notability.py`; that datamine (name + drops + boss
  frame), not a raw NpcParam field, is the correct source.

**Confidence:** HIGH. The negative (teamType/npcType are not category keys) is direct from the data;
the positive (Ghost=invader) is already shipped and cross-validated live in production code.

## Tier 4 — Lore / Miscellaneous / Quest — INVESTIGATED (Lore+Misc: no game-data source; Quest: already covered)

Short pass only (prompt forbids implementation here). Source: `docs/coverage_vs_mapgenie.md`.

**Lore (6) and Miscellaneous (9) — NO in-game data source exists; HYPOTHESIS = not implementable
mod-agnostically.** Both are classified in the coverage doc under **"Other (guide annotations)"** — they
are MapGenie *editorial* pins (a human wiki editor dropped a marker and wrote a note), not derived from
any param/MSB/EMEVD field. There is nothing in the game files that says "this point is Lore". The only
source is MapGenie's own annotation content, and that is explicitly OFF-LIMITS per
`docs/memory/features/quest-browser.md`: "MapGenie rejected as the step/location source: proprietary
commercial data (ToS forbids scraping) + its coords are MapGenie-space not ER-space." ⇒ Recommend these
two stay permanently uncovered (drop from the coverage target as "wiki annotation, no game data"), not
scoped as RE work. 15 pins total.

**Quest (steps) (7) — ALREADY COVERED; confirm, do not implement (matches prompt).** The mod already
draws its own quest content well beyond MapGenie's 7: `docs/coverage_vs_mapgenie.md` lists
**Quest - Progression = 73** and **Quest - Seedbed Curses = 7** as mod-drawn categories, plus the
runtime `QuestNpcLayer` pins **71 quest NPCs** (mod-agnostic EMEVD extractor, live-verified on ERR
v2.2.9.6 — `docs/memory/features/quest-browser.md`). MapGenie's "Quest (steps) — 7" is a small editorial
subset of this (the count even matches the 7 Seedbed Curses exactly, a plausible identity though not the
load-bearing claim). Belief HOLDS: no new code needed for MapGenie Quest — the mod's quest coverage
(150+ markers + browser) already exceeds it.

_Note: MapGenie's "Stone Cairn (5)" is also an "Other (guide annotations)" location and was already
covered under Tier 2(B) as a non-WorldMapPointParam interactable._

**Confidence:** HIGH for the negative (Lore/Misc have no game-data source — direct from the taxonomy
grouping + the documented MapGenie-source rejection). Quest = confirmed-already-covered.

---

## Overall status — RE brief DISCHARGED

All tiers verified against real disk data (vanilla + ERR), every plan hypothesis was wrong or imprecise
but the correct mechanism in each case already exists in shipped code:
- **A(a)** `disableRespawn`: gate = `dr==0 AND non-boss` (not `dr==1`=boss).
- **A(b)** farmable collectible: single master `getItemFlagId==0 OR flag_is_repeatable` (not the 01/02/03
  slots), already read at `resolve_loot_flag`.
- **Tier 2** landmarks: iconId key for the named-location subset (Divine Tower 23 / Evergaol 9 / Minor
  Erdtree 30 / Grand Lift 21 / Dungeon & Legacy sets); the rest aren't WorldMapPointParam.
- **Tier 3** NPCs: only Ghost=invader is param-clean (= existing `WorldHostileNPC`); the other 5 need
  ShopLineupParam / QuestNpcLayer / notability-datamine.
- **Tier 4** Lore/Misc: no game-data source (MapGenie editorial); Quest already covered.

Implementation remains gated on `generated_data_removal_plan.md` Phase B (per the plan's sequencing) —
this pass only turned hypotheses into cited facts so that Phase-B implementation is copy-paste-confident.
