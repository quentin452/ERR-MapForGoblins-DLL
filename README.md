# ELDEN RING Map For Goblins - DLL

A DLL mod for Elden Ring that adds thousands of icons to the world map: weapons, armor, spells, quest items, bosses, NPCs, gathering nodes, etc. Four builds: one for [ERR](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/541) (~9000 icons, including ERR-specific content like Rune Pieces), one for the vanilla game + Shadow of the Erdtree (~6700 icons), one for [The Convergence](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3419) (~7200 icons generated from the overhaul's own data), and one for [ERTE](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/2747) (~7600 icons generated from the overhaul's own data).

**Download:** [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/10062) · **Community:** [Elden Ring - DLL Mods Discord](https://discord.gg/JvTMwPCygB)

Unlike [Map for Goblins](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3091), this mod does not modify `regulation.bin`. All map point data is injected into memory at runtime, so it won't conflict with other regulation edits.

> **Note:** OFFLINE only. This is an unofficial mod, not affiliated with the ERR team, the Convergence Team, or the ERTE author.

Collected Rune Pieces, Ember Pieces and gathering nodes are automatically hidden on the map using real-time memory detection of the game's geometry object state.

## Features

- ~9000 map icons across 60+ toggleable categories (configurable via INI)
- Map text sourced from existing in-game FMG entries (all 14 languages) via a MsgRepository hook — each marker redirects to a goods/weapon/armour/etc. name by ID, so translations come for free
- Collected Rune/Ember Piece detection: GEOF singletons for unloaded tiles + CSWorldGeomMan flags for loaded tiles
- [Item & Enemy Randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/428) support (vanilla build, on by default): loot markers read the loaded `ItemLotParam` from live memory at startup, so each shows the item actually placed by your seed (name + icon) and hides on the real light-point pickup — seed-agnostic, no per-seed data
- Spoiler-free mode (`anonymous_loot` INI option): every loot marker shows a gray "?" icon and a generic localized label instead of the real item, for blind / randomizer runs
- No regulation.bin changes - no conflicts with other mods
- Addon-compatible folder structure for ERR

## Building

Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2022 (Build Tools or Community)
- CMake 3.28+
- Internet connection (CMake fetches dependencies on first configure)

```bash
build.bat              # configure + build
build.bat snapshot     # run the full data pipeline + build + package into pre-release/
build.bat release      # same as snapshot, but non-pre version + bumps patch version
build.bat generate     # run the data pipeline only (no DLL build)
build.bat clean        # delete build directory
```

Every command builds the ERR profile by default. Append `--vanilla`,
`--convergence`, or `--erte` to build the other profiles (own data/source/build/
package dirs; see `tools/config.ini.example` for the required paths). The
Convergence and ERTE profiles stage a merged overlay-over-vanilla source view
first, since those overhauls ship a partial ModEngine overlay.

Output: `build/Release/MapForGoblins.dll` + `MapForGoblins.ini`

## Installation

Grab a packaged release from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/10062) — it has step-by-step instructions for all four builds (ERR; vanilla via ModEngine2/me3; The Convergence via its bundled ModEngine2; ERTE via Mod Engine 3).

Manual install of the ERR build:
1. Copy `MapForGoblins.dll` and `MapForGoblins.ini` to your ERR `dll/offline/` directory
2. Copy `addons/MapForGoblins/menu/02_120_worldmap.gfx` to ERR `addons/MapForGoblins/menu/`
All map data is compiled into the DLL itself - no external data files needed at runtime.

## Data Pipeline

The mod's map data is generated from ERR game files through a Python pipeline
orchestrated by `tools/build_pipeline.py` (18 stages, hash-based incremental cache):

```
MSB + regulation.bin + EMEVD
    │
    ├─► extract_all_items.py        → items_database.json
    ├─► build_entity_index.py       → msb_entity_index.json
    ├─► scan_emevd_awards.py        → emevd_lot_mapping.json
    ├─► enrich_fallback_with_emevd.py (upgrades unmatched records in-place)
    │
    ├─► generate_loot_massedit.py   → 50+ Loot/Equipment/Key/Quest/Magic MASSEDIT
    ├─► generate_pieces_massedit.py → Rune/Ember MASSEDIT + slot mappings
    ├─► generate_material_nodes.py, generate_graces.py, generate_summoning_pools.py,
    │   generate_spirit_springs.py, generate_imp_statues.py, generate_stakes.py,
    │   generate_paintings.py, generate_maps.py, generate_gestures.py,
    │   generate_hostile_npcs.py    → world-infrastructure MASSEDIT
    │
    └─► generate_data.py → goblin_map_data.cpp + goblin_legacy_conv.hpp
                              │
                              └─► build.bat → MapForGoblins.dll
```

### Python Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp tools/config.ini.example tools/config.ini
# Edit config.ini with paths to your ERR mod and game directories
```

See [tools/README.md](tools/README.md) for detailed script documentation.
